    Free South Africa was a political response to the conditions of apartheid that still existed in South Africa. The black figure is intentionally much larger than the white figure to express the irony of a post-colonial era where a white minority continued to suppress the majority native black population. The use of black lines makes for a sense of dynamic movement of the figures. Black outlines also express a heightened awareness of more psychologically charged elements - like the aura hovering around the restraining collar around the neck of the black figure.

    This mural (1986) on handball court at 128th Street and 2nd Avenue was inspired by the crack epidemic and its effect on New York City. It was created as a warning and was initially executed independently, without City permission. The mural was immediately put under the protection and jurisdiction of the City Department of Parks and still exists.

      Boxers is one of the Keith Haring’s most influential sculptures, Boxers (1988) was created in Germany where it remains in front of the Grand Hyatt Hotel on Potsdamer Platz. Despite the name of this piece, the two figures depicted are rather engaged in a seemingly erotic embrace. Created two years before the artist’s untimely death from AIDS, the sculpture features sexuality and violence, both of which often intersect in Haring’s work.

      Radiant Baby, also known by the names Radiant Child and Radiant Christ, is one of the most iconic images from street art legend Keith Haring. The simple character Radiant Baby first appeared in the subway graffiti of Keith Haring, the artist regularly using it as a tag to sign his street art. Radiant Baby has its origins in Christianity and Haring’s involvement in the 1970’s with the Jesus Movement, whose followers were tagged Jesus People or Jesus Freaks. Although Keith Haring left the Jesus Movement, the experience left its mark on the artworks, with the Radiant Baby also making appearances in a nativity scene and sitting on top of a mushroom cloud. Listen to Shepard Fairey discussing Radiant Baby and Keith Haring in this Keith Haring x OBEY Collaboration video.

      Street art legend Keith Haring was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987, causing a burst of activity from the artist to create as much work as possible, with many having a focus on AIDS. Iconic work Ignorance = Fear was completed in 1989 and features the distinctive style of Haring sending out a strong message about the AIDS epidemic, which had claimed the lives of several of his friends. These AIDS related artworks by Keith Haring were aimed at giving a voice to those who were suffering silently at the time, often using the pink triangle in the works, an image that was reclaimed by the gay rights movement after originally being used during the holocaust to identify those being targeted for homosexuality.
